# kickstarter-analysis
  ## Overview
    This project is looking at how other Theatre and Play Kickstarters did based on their launch date and their goal amount.

      ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- I only had one difficulty encountered which was self-inflicted, after creating the Countifs functions for the Goals, I had not specified the criteria for "plays". I fixed that by going back entering in the "plays" criteria for the worksheet. There could many other difficulties with the Countifs function, like not knowing the syntax for greater than and less than between two numbers. 
         
   ## Results
   
- Two conclusions that I can draw from the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart are that the most successful theater KickStarter campaigns happen in May, and that  it would ---  be a high risk to start a Theater KickStarter Campaign in December because the chance the campaign succeeds is the same as the chance that the campaign fails.
 
- I can conclude from the Outcomes Based on Goals chart that KickStarter Campaigns for plays with a goal of less than 5000 are more likely to be successful than all other campaign goals.

- The limitiations of this dataset could be that there were no descriptors of who was creating the KickStarter. Like say if Christopher Walken wanted it for "Walken on Sunshine" it could not get money because he is a famous actor who should be able to fund the play itself. That also is a limitation with the Spotlight column. What kind of Spotlight does it mean? Did the campaign go viral on twitter, did an actor happen to see the campaign and donated handsomely, what qualifies as spotlight? I feel there could be many more conclusions drawn from Author of a Kickstarter , and how Spotlight was gained on a  Kickstarter.

- A chart that I would very much like to see is a chart of Plays Outcomes based on Goals with a filter of Spotlight. I believe that Spotlight is how many people had seen the campaign, and from a cursory glance it looked like many of the successful KickStarters had a Spotlight of "Yes".
