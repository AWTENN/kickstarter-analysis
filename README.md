      ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
         I only had one difficulty encountered which was self-inflicted, after creating the Countifs functions for the Goals, I had not specified the criteria for "plays". I fixed that by going back entering in the "plays" criteria for the worksheet. There could many other difficulties with the Countifs function, like not knowing the syntax for greater than and less than between two numbers.
